# Unify

**A website built to make a step forward in building a more inclusive community.**

A website built to break the barriers of sign communication with people who are hard of hearing. A website to sensitise people, especially emergency responders, teachers and parents. People who are hard of hearing have difficulty communicating in emergency situations. We wanted to come up with a way to educate people on how they can help. Unify is an ASL learning website centered around learning the ASL alphabet to help in emergency situations. 
- **Learn** ASL letters and common emergency signs
